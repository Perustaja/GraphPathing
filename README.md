# Explanation
Implementation of a BFS algorithm to path an object through a 2D matrix. Based on the terrain of each vertice, a path is calculated that takes into account the efficiency of following roads as opposed to grass. 

Based on the path taken, fuel expended, time taken, and distance traveled are calculated naively. The best path is selected solely on time to destination.
